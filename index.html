            <p>By using this website you are agreeing to taking part in a controlled experiment about web service authentication. In this experiment you will be given one of two authentication methods to use. A standard password, or a mnemoic. You will recieve up to $4 for completing the experiment. $1 for creating an account with your assinged method, $1 for logging in after creating an account, $1 for logging in a second time 24 hours from your first login attempt, and $1 for completing the short exit survey. Please note if you can not remember your password you can use the forgot my pasword button on the login page in order to login (doing this will still count towards your $1 for that task). You will recieve an email reminding you to login after 24 hours has passed, and one asking what your prefered payment method is after completing the experiment. Please note all traffic is encrypted over https and industry leading password hashing (Argon2) and protection techinques so your data is safe and secure from malicous actors.
